# Agent Workflow: Commit, Build, Test, and PR

Use this workflow when the user asks to "finalize", "push", or "create a PR" for the current changes.

## 1. Pre-Check & Validation
Before committing, ensure the codebase is healthy.
- **Lint**: Run `pnpm lint` (frontend/backend).
- **Test**: Run `pnpm test` or `pnpm exec vitest run`.

## 2. Commit on Feature Branch
Commit all changes on the current feature branch.
- **Check Status**: `git status` to see what changed.
- **Stage**: `git add .` (or specific files).
- **Commit**: Use a semantic commit message (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`).

## 3. Merge to Develop & Build (Local Verification)

**Critical**: This step verifies the merge will succeed on develop by actually merging and building locally.

**Command Sequence:**
```bash
# Save current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Checkout develop and merge
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Run build and capture output
pnpm build > build.log 2>&1
BUILD_EXIT_CODE=$?

# Capture last 10 lines of build output
BUILD_OUTPUT=$(tail -n 10 build.log)

# Capture diff stats (last 10 lines)
DIFF_PREVIEW=$(git diff HEAD~1 --stat | tail -n 10)
```

**Now branch based on build result:**

### ✅ If Build Succeeds (`$BUILD_EXIT_CODE == 0`)

```bash
# Reset develop to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Return to feature branch
git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Cleanup build log
rm -f build.log

# Push feature branch to remote
git push
# Or: git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH" (if first push)

# Proceed to Step 4 (Create PR)
```

### ❌ If Build Fails (`$BUILD_EXIT_CODE != 0`)

```bash
# Reset develop to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Return to feature branch
git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Display error to user
echo "❌ Build failed after merge. Please fix the issues and try again."
echo "Build output:"
cat build.log

# Cleanup build log
rm -f build.log

# DO NOT create PR
# Agent should wait for user to fix issues, then restart from Step 1
```

## 4. Create Pull Request (via GitHub CLI)

**Only proceed here if build succeeded in Step 3.**

Use the `gh` CLI to create the PR efficiently.

**PR Title Convention:**
- **If branch has ID (e.g. `feature/DIFFAPP-123-...`)**: `[DIFFAPP-123] <Description>`
- **Otherwise**: `<type>: <description>`

**Command Template:**
```bash
# Extract ID from branch name if possible
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$BRANCH_NAME" =~ DIFFAPP-[0-9]+ ]]; then
  ID=${BASH_REMATCH[0]}
  TITLE="[$ID] <Semantic Title>"
else
  TITLE="<type>: <Semantic Title>"
fi

gh pr create \
  --base develop \
  --head "$BRANCH_NAME" \
  --title "$TITLE" \
  --body "## Description
<Brief summary of changes>

## Files Changed (Preview)
\`\`\`
$DIFF_PREVIEW
\`\`\`

## Build Output
\`\`\`
$BUILD_OUTPUT
\`\`\`"
```

## Workflow Checklist for Agent

### Pre-Flight
1.  [ ] Did I run pre-checks (lint + test) and verify they passed?
2.  [ ] Did I commit changes on the feature branch with a semantic message?

### Build Verification
3.  [ ] Did I merge to develop locally?
4.  [ ] Did I run `pnpm build` and capture the exit code?
5.  [ ] Did I capture diff stats and build output (last 10 lines)?

### Conditional Branch
6.  [ ] **If build succeeded**: Did I reset develop, push feature branch, and create PR?
7.  [ ] **If build failed**: Did I reset develop, return to feature branch, and inform user?

---

## Example Interaction

**User**: "OK, push this and create a PR."

**Agent (Success Path)**: 
1. ✅ Runs `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` → All pass
2. ✅ Commits changes: `git commit -m "feat: add VIP icon and unit tests"`
3. ✅ Merges to develop: `git checkout develop && git merge --no-ff feature/DIFFAPP-XXX`
4. ✅ Builds: `pnpm build` → Success (exit code 0)
5. ✅ Captures diff stats and build output
6. ✅ Resets develop: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
7. ✅ Returns to feature branch: `git checkout feature/DIFFAPP-XXX`
8. ✅ Pushes: `git push`
9. ✅ Creates PR: `gh pr create` with diff and build output
10. ✅ Responds: "PR created successfully: [link]"

**Agent (Failure Path)**:
1. ✅ Runs `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` → All pass
2. ✅ Commits changes
3. ✅ Merges to develop
4. ❌ Builds: `pnpm build` → **FAIL** (exit code 1)
5. ❌ Resets develop: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
6. ❌ Returns to feature branch
7. ❌ Responds: "Build failed after merge to develop. Please review the build errors below and fix them. Once fixed, I'll restart the workflow."
8. ❌ Shows build log to user
9. ⏸️ Waits for user to fix issues

## Safety Rules

❌ **NEVER:**

- Force push (`git push --force` or `--force-with-lease`)
- Push to `master`, `staging`, or `develop` directly
- Use `git commit --amend` after a commit has been pushed
- Skip lint/build checks

✅ **ALWAYS:**

- Use semantic commit messages
- Run pre-checks before commit
- Use regular `git push` (or `git push -u origin <branch>` for first push)
- Create new commits instead of amending pushed commits
